The first solution is easy and intuitive. Use a dictionary to record the appearances of each number. 

Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = Counter()
        for num in nums:
            res[num] += 1
            if res[num] > len(nums) / 2:
                return num
```



Another tricky method can reduce space complexity to O(1). Notice that the majority element appears more than sum of all other elements. So we "track" the current majority element, if any other element appears, count of the majority element reduces by 1.

```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = nums[0]; count = 0
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                res = num
                count += 1
            else:
                if res == num:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count -= 1
        
        return res
```
