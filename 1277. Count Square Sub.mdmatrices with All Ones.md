In the dynamic matrix, each position represents the number of required squares whose bottom left corner at that position. 

That means if one position has value $n$, there will be a square, with all value of 1, bottom left corner at the position.

Then we try to figure out the size of square can reach at $(i,j)$, it's determined by the value of itself, its above position, left position and left above position.

```Pytho
class Solution():    
    def countSquares(self, A):
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            for j in range(1, len(A[0])):
                if A[i-1][j-1] * A[i][j-1] * A[i-1][j] * A[i][j] == 0:
                    pass
                else:
                    A[i][j] = min(A[i-1][j], A[i][j-1], A[i-1][j-1]) + 1
        return sum(map(sum, A))
```

Sum the matrix to get all possible required squares.
