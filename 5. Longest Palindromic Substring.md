The simplest solution is to check every "center" of possible palindromic substrings. For each center, extend the substring from length of 1 or 2. It's eaay to check whether the extension should stop. The point is that time complexity is only O(1) for each palindromic checking and check only necessary substrings.



The second method is dynamic programming. It uses a 2D array to mark if each substring is palindromic. In each checking, interior substring can be used without recalculating. In this way, it's also O(1) time for each checking. But this will search all possible substrings and have $o(n^2)$ space complexity.



The former solution is

```java
class Solution {

    String res = "";

    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if(s.length() < 2) return s;

        for(int i = 0; i < s.length()-1; i++) {
            extend(s, i, i);
            extend(s, i, i+1);
        }

        return res;
    }

    private void extend(String s, int i, int j) {
        while(i>=0 && j<s.length() && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
            i--;
            j++;
        }
        i++; j--; // go back for one step
        if(j-i+1 > res.length()) res = s.substring(i, j+1);
    }
}
```
